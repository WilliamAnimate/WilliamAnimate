## Is your name actually William?

yes lol

## Did you actually make [LTS.exe](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo)?

No. i only gave [Fikinoob (click here)](https://github.com/fikinoob) the tools to do so
And before you ask, no, you may not get [LTS](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo) until [fikinoob](https://github.com/fikinoob) releases it (if i have permission, i may also release the binary along with it and probably the source or something)
