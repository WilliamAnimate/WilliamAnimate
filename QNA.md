# William's Unspecial QNA!

## Is your name actually William?
I got this name when i came to Canada a (long) while back. 

## Did you actually make [LTS.exe?](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo)
No. i only gave [Fikinoob (click here)](https://github.com/fikinoob) the tools to do so
And before you ask, no, you may not get [LTS](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo) until [fiki](https://github.com/fikinoob)[*pro* (<- joke)](https://github.com/pro) releases it (in which, if i have permission may also release the binary along with it and probably the source)
also programming language is programming language, js is js, getting cancelled.. is.... wait don't do that
## Who made your PFP or did you make it by yourself
the person who made by pfp is [Here (R.I.P)](https://scratch.mit.edu/alpha_coder) and specified person's API (for proof of existance) [Here (RIP v2)](https://api.scratch.mit.edu/users/aIpha_coder)
