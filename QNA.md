# <u>Q</u>uestion <u>N</u>' <u>A</u>nswer

## Is your name actually William?
I got this name when i came to Canada a (long) while back. 

## Did you actually make [LTS.exe](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo)?
No. i only gave [Fikinoob (click here)](https://github.com/fikinoob) the tools to do so
And before you ask, no, you may not get [LTS](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo) until [fiki](https://github.com/fikinoob)[*pro* (<- joke)](https://github.com/pro) releases it (in which, if i have permission may also release the binary along with it and probably the source)
also programming language is programming language, js is js, getting cancelled.. is.... wait don't do that
