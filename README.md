# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm WilliamAnimate, your terrible programmer that takes 5 hours just to finish one line of code (working to make this shorter, i'm sorry

### WAIT!, i seen you in [a **block** website](https://scratch.mit.edu)
[that website **"blocked"** my account for the dumb reason of "Due to your agreement with the appeals desk you would use CreatorWilliam Only" (i never agreed to anything..)](https://youtu.be/xUDMkfaCjNg)

**(it uses blocks because it** ***blocks*** **you from the website for NO REASON)**
