# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm WilliamAnimate, your terrible programmer that takes 5 hours just to finish one line of code (working to make this shorter, i'm sorry

### WAIT!, i seen you in [a **block** website](https://scratch.mit.edu)
[that website **"blocked"** my account for the ~~dumb~~ confusing reason of "Due to your agreement with the appeals desk you would use CreatorWilliam Only" (i never agreed to anything..)](https://youtu.be/xUDMkfaCjNg)
just in case you wonder
<!-- you may be asking, William, where is the scratch roast? i removed it just in case github might get mad at me, since i cant edit this on my browser and had to use edge... microsoft, i beg you. please be a better company and stop glitching out all my stuff.
not to mention edge is actually really, really really laggy for me. -->

# READ BEFORE USING CODE
Feel free to use my code! just make sure to give credit. (you may use it in a private environment, its not like anyone will stop you if you use code for **your computer only** *(some licenses don't like that, but i like it simple!)*

# ***[ðŸ˜ duckduckgo is no longer as good now. they broke the promise of "we will never track you. ever" (click to see article)](https://www.techradar.com/news/duckduckgo-in-hot-water-over-hidden-tracking-agreement-with-microsoft)***
