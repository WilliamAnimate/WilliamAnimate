# Hey there, traveller! ðŸ‘‹

**Before you ask, Yes, im the [person from scratch.](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/william_animate)
[Where were i? this youtube video should explain it](https://youtu.be/xUDMkfaCjNg)**
<!-- 
you may be asking, William, where is the scratch roast? i removed it just in case github might get mad at me, 
also i can't edit this on my browser and had to use edge... microsoft, i beg you. please be a better company and stop glitching out all my stuff.
not to mention edge is actually really, really really laggy for me.
