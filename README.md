# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
WilliamAnimate, your terrible programmer that takes 5 hours just to finish one line of code

### WAIT!, i seen you in the [block website](https://scratch.mit.edu) where you put [blocks to do coding](https://scratch.mit.edu)
[that website "blocked" my account for the dumb reason of "Due to your agreement with the appeals desk you would use CreatorWilliam Only"](https://youtu.be/xUDMkfaCjNg)
***FIRST OF ALL, WHAT AGREEMENT???!!!***

[Its as if they have some sort of quota of "blocking" they need to reach every month or they'll get fired.. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUDMkfaCjNg&lc=Ugw9MuwJxiwEX2BQLiZ4AaABAg.9_N-OHRLWFc9aJeF3cQ_0K)
