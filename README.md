# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm WilliamAnimate, your terrible programmer that takes 5 hours just to finish one line of code (working to make this shorter, i'm sorry

### WAIT!, i seen you in [a **block** website](https://scratch.mit.edu)
[that website **"blocked"** my account for the ~~dumb~~ confusing reason of "Due to your agreement with the appeals desk you would use CreatorWilliam Only" (i never agreed to anything..)](https://youtu.be/xUDMkfaCjNg)
just in case you wonder
<!-- you may be asking, William, where is the scratch roast? i removed it just in case github might get mad at me, since i cant edit this on my browser and had to use edge... microsoft, i beg you. please be a better company and stop glitching out all my stuff.
not to mention edge is actually really, really really laggy for me. -->

# QNA
<!-- ## Is your name actually William?
I got this name when i came to Canada a (long) while back. 
reilc for people digging in the code. its too long -->
# How do i reach you?
[william.animate.other@outlook.com (Not perferred but i do check it. use for rather-low priority) (click.. if mailto:// works)](mailto://william.animate.other@outlook.com) or [William_animate#7884 (Perferred option. but i recommend you do this if you need to reach me quick. (click)](https://discord.com/users/720264552285208666)

# Other QNA goes [Here (not programmed yet lol there is nothing you can do to stop me from being lazy) (also a placeholder that takes you here)](https://github.com/williamanimate/williamanimate/readme.md#QNA)

**while you wait, this will stay here until i program it.**

## Did you actually make [LTS.exe?](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo)
No. i only gave [Fikinoob (click here)](https://github.com/fikinoob) the tools to do so
And before you ask, no, you may not get [LTS](https://youtu.be/Ha-0MIpaieo) until [fiki](https://github.com/fikinoob)[*pro* (<- joke)](https://github.com/pro) releases it (in which, if i have permission may also release the binary along with it and probably the source)
also programming language is programming language, js is js, getting cancelled.. is.... wait don't do that
## Who made your PFP or did you make it by yourself
the person who made by pfp is [Here (R.I.P)](https://scratch.mit.edu/alpha_coder) and specified person's API (for proof of existance) [Here (RIP v2)](https://api.scratch.mit.edu/users/aIpha_coder)

# READ BEFORE USING CODE
Feel free to use my code! just make sure to give credit. (you may use it in a private environment, its not like anyone will stop you if you use code for **your computer only** *(some licenses don't like that, but i like it simple!)*

# ***[ðŸ˜ duckduckgo is no longer as good now. they broke the promise of "we will never track you. ever" (click to see article)](https://www.techradar.com/news/duckduckgo-in-hot-water-over-hidden-tracking-agreement-with-microsoft)***
