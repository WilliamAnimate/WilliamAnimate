# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
WilliamAnimate, your terrible programmer that takes 5 hours just to finish one line of code

### WAIT!, i seen you in the block website where you put blocks to do coding
that website "blocked" my account for the dumb reason of "Due to your agreement with the appeals desk you would use CreatorWilliam Only"
# FIRST OF ALL, WHAT AGREEMENT
![Its as if they have some sort of quota of "blocking" they need to reach every month or they'll get fired.. (go to comments if you click on me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUDMkfaCjNg&lc=Ugw9MuwJxiwEX2BQLiZ4AaABAg.9_N-OHRLWFc9aJeF3cQ_0K)
