# Hey there, traveller! 👋

I'm WilliamAnimate, your local frontend web designer and Rust programmer. I'm suprisingly *not* powered by coffee.

### I'm currently learning

- 🦀 Rust
- C
- Go (for educational, very legit purposes 🔥 🗣️ 🗣️ :fire:)

psst! My daily driver is an Arch Linux install (i use arch btw) running KDE Plasma. My secondary machine is an extremely bloated CachyOS install running i3wm.
